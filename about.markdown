Thanks for stopping by! While you're here, let me tell you a little bit about myself. I'm a [Knowledge Engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_engineer) for [Alexa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Alexa). Basically, that means I help make Alexa smarter. <details><summary>Not satisfied?</summary>
> We develop end-to-end knowledge products, from identifying customer needs and managing content categories to ingesting data, developing ontologies, and designing multimodal experiences. Still confused? I don't blame you. At the core, we improve Alexa's ability to answer questions. We do this by expanding our [knowledge graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph) and defining semantic relationships between constructs within this graph. We can then access this structured information to generate answers in voice and graphical user interfaces for Alexa customers. Want to learn more? This [Wired article](https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-alexa-search-for-the-one-perfect-answer) goes into Alexa's history, technology, and future outlook in great detail.</details>

I work with an awesome team named [Graphiq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphiq), formerly a semantic technology company before we were acquired by Amazon in May 2017. We're located in beautiful Santa Barbara and [always hiring](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/locations/sba-california) those who share our passions for voice technology and long walks on the beach (disclaimer: the latter is not actually a job requirement, but I'd highly recommend after hitting the [Funk Zone](https://www.funkzone.net/map-of-the-zone)).

When I'm not spending time with Alexa, you can find me tasting and [obsessively tracking](https://untappd.com/user/sbbaker) beer, [playing poker](https://www.wsop.com/players/profile/?playerid=233904) and spending time with my human girlfriend. I also like to create things, including this portfolio and my ramblings contained within.

Thanks for stopping by! I'm not sure how you've found me â€” we're still working on our Bat-Signal. Anyway, while you're here, let me tell you about myself.

I'm a [Knowledge Engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_engineer) for [Alexa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Alexa). Basically, that means I help make Alexa smarter. <details><summary>Not satisfied?</summary>
> We develop knowledge products end-to-end, from understanding customer needs and managing product categories to transforming data, developing ontologies, and designing multimodal experiences. Still confused? I don't blame you... Well, you know the age-old question: [Is a hotdog a sandwich?](http://matthematics.com/sandwiches-and-the-ontology-of-definitions/) It's like that, except doing it for everything that has ever existed (well, most things are easier to model, but [vagueness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagueness#mw-content-text:~:text=The%20disagreement%20over%20whether%20a%20hotdog%20is%20a%20sandwich%20suggests%20that%20%E2%80%9Csandwich%E2%80%9D%20is%20vague.) is more fun) and building a knowledge graph to connect these concepts. We can then access this structured information to design answers in a voice-user interface or let the system naturally generate language itself.</details>

I work with an awesome team named [Graphiq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphiq), formerly a semantic technology company before we were acquired by Amazon in May 2017. We're in beautiful Santa Barbara and [always hiring](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/locations/sba-california) those who share our passions for voice technology and long walks on the beach (disclaimer: the latter is not actually a job requirement, but I'd highly recommend after hitting the [Funk Zone](https://www.funkzone.net/map-of-the-zone)).

When I'm not spending time with Alexa, you can find me tasting (and [obsessively tracking](https://untappd.com/user/sbbaker)) beer, [playing poker](https://www.wsop.com/players/profile/?playerid=233904) and reminiscing about past travel [through photos](https://vsco.co/spencerbaker/gallery).

Want to tell me your feelings about hotdogs being sandwiches or chat about something else? Feel free to [tweet](https://twitter.com/spencerbakes) or [email](mailto:spencerbenjaminbaker@gmail.com) me.
